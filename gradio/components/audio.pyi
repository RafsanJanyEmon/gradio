    Creates an audio component that can be used to upload/record audio (as an input) or display audio (as an output).
    Preprocessing: passes the uploaded audio as a {Tuple(int, numpy.array)} corresponding to (sample rate in Hz, audio data as a 16-bit int array whose values range from -32768 to 32767), or as a {str} filepath, depending on `type`.
    Postprocessing: expects a {Tuple(int, numpy.array)} corresponding to (sample rate in Hz, audio data as a float or int numpy array) or as a {str} or {pathlib.Path} filepath or URL to an audio file, or bytes for binary content (recommended for streaming)
    Examples-format: a {str} filepath to a local file that contains audio.

        Parameters:
            value: A path, URL, or [sample_rate, numpy array] tuple (sample rate in Hz, audio data as a float or int numpy array) for the default value that Audio component is going to take. If callable, the function will be called whenever the app loads to set the initial value of the component.
            source: Source of audio. "upload" creates a box where user can drop an audio file, "microphone" creates a microphone input.
            type: The format the audio file is converted to before being passed into the prediction function. "numpy" converts the audio to a tuple consisting of: (int sample rate, numpy.array for the data), "filepath" passes a str path to a temporary file containing the audio.
            label: component name in interface.
            every: If `value` is a callable, run the function 'every' number of seconds while the client connection is open. Has no effect otherwise. Queue must be enabled. The event can be accessed (e.g. to cancel it) via this component's .load_event attribute.
            show_label: if True, will display label.
            container: If True, will place the component in a container - providing some extra padding around the border.
            scale: relative width compared to adjacent Components in a Row. For example, if Component A has scale=2, and Component B has scale=1, A will be twice as wide as B. Should be an integer.
            min_width: minimum pixel width, will wrap if not sufficient screen space to satisfy this value. If a certain scale value results in this Component being narrower than min_width, the min_width parameter will be respected first.
            interactive: if True, will allow users to upload and edit a audio file; if False, can only be used to play audio. If not provided, this is inferred based on whether the component is used as an input or output.
            visible: If False, component will be hidden.
            streaming: If set to True when used in a `live` interface as an input, will automatically stream webcam feed. When used set as an output, takes audio chunks yield from the backend and combines them into one streaming audio output.
            elem_id: An optional string that is assigned as the id of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.
            elem_classes: An optional list of strings that are assigned as the classes of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.
            format: The file format to save audio files. Either 'wav' or 'mp3'. wav files are lossless but will tend to be larger files. mp3 files tend to be smaller. Default is wav. Applies both when this component is used as an input (when `type` is "format") and when this component is used as an output.
            autoplay: Whether to automatically play the audio when the component is used as an output. Note: browsers will not autoplay audio files if the user has not interacted with the page yet.
            show_download_button: If True, will show a download button in the corner of the component for saving audio. If False, icon does not appear.
            show_share_button: If True, will show a share icon in the corner of the component that allows user to share outputs to Hugging Face Spaces Discussions. If False, icon does not appear. If set to None (default behavior), then the icon appears if this Gradio app is launched on Spaces, but not otherwise.
            show_edit_button: If True, will show an edit icon in the corner of the component that allows user to edit the audio. If False, icon does not appear. Default is True.

            postprocess: If False, will not run postprocessing of component data before returning 'fn' output to the browser.
            cancels: A list of other events to cancel when this listener is triggered. For example, setting cancels=[click_event] will cancel the click_event, where click_event is the return value of another components .click method. Functions that have not yet run (or generators that are iterating) will be cancelled, but functions that are currently running will be allowed to finish.

        Parameters:
            fn: the function to call when this event is triggered. Often a machine learning model's prediction function. Each parameter of the function corresponds to one input component, and the function should return a single value or a tuple of values, with each element in the tuple corresponding to one output component.
            inputs: List of gradio.components to use as inputs. If the function takes no inputs, this should be an empty list.
            outputs: List of gradio.components to use as outputs. If the function returns no outputs, this should be an empty list.
            api_name: Defines how the endpoint appears in the API docs. Can be a string, None, or False. If False, the endpoint will not be exposed in the api docs. If set to None, the endpoint will be exposed in the api docs as an unnamed endpoint, although this behavior will be changed in Gradio 4.0. If set to a string, the endpoint will be exposed in the api docs with the given name.
            status_tracker: Deprecated and has no effect.
            scroll_to_output: If True, will scroll to output component on completion
            show_progress: If True, will show progress animation while pending
            queue: If True, will place the request on the queue, if the queue has been enabled. If False, will not put this event on the queue, even if the queue has been enabled. If None, will use the queue setting of the gradio app.
            batch: If True, then the function should process a batch of inputs, meaning that it should accept a list of input values for each parameter. The lists should be of equal length (and be up to length `max_batch_size`). The function is then *required* to return a tuple of lists (even if there is only 1 output component), with each list in the tuple corresponding to one output component.
            max_batch_size: Maximum number of inputs to batch together if this is called from the queue (only relevant if batch=True)
            preprocess: If False, will not run preprocessing of component data before running 'fn' (e.g. leaving it as a base64 string if this method is called with the `Image` component).
            postprocess: If False, will not run postprocessing of component data before returning 'fn' output to the browser.
            cancels: A list of other events to cancel when this listener is triggered. For example, setting cancels=[click_event] will cancel the click_event, where click_event is the return value of another components .click method. Functions that have not yet run (or generators that are iterating) will be cancelled, but functions that are currently running will be allowed to finish.
            every: Run this event 'every' number of seconds while the client connection is open. Interpreted in seconds. Queue must be enabled.
